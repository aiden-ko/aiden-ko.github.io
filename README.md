Aldrich Zabaldica

Well, hello there! Welcome to my website where you'll get to know me more. I'm Aldrich R. Zabaldica, a student who loves reading and making essays. However, I think I have more things that would be helpful for other people to know me or maybe some things here might be applicable for a job interview in the future, eh?

Favorite Joke: One of my hobby is playing the rubiks cube. Its like a math problem that I can't solve.

# Hobbies
Sometimes. I also take a video of myself studying. Even though I used to dream of being a youtuber, I don't think I can be really hands-on if I ever be one. 
I'm also intersted in photography especially nature and the things that I see. (Here are some of my videos and pictures):
