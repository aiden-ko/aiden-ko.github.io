Aldrich Zabaldica

Well, hello there! Welcome to my website where you'll get to know me more. I'm Aldrich R. Zabaldica, a student who loves reading and writing essays. However, I think I have more things that would be helpful for other people to know me, or maybe some things here might be applicable for a job interview in the future, eh?

Favorite Joke: One of my hobbies is playing with the Rubiks cube. Its like a math problem that I can't solve.

> I usually listen to Taylor Swift because I like her music style. So I guess I can say she's my favorite artist. To add, I also listen to Filipino songs as you can see in the playlists above.

# A Memory
When I was little, I loved drawing stick-man figures, so by sharing an image of my drawing, I hope that you'll get to know me better.
