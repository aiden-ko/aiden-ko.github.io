Aldrich Zabaldica

Well, hello there! Welcome to my website where you'll get to know me more. I'm Aldrich R. Zabaldica, a student who loves reading and making essays. However, I think I have more things that would be helpful for other people to know me or maybe some things here might be applicable for a job interview in the future, eh?

Favorite Joke: One of my hobby is playing the rubiks cube. Its like a math problem that I can't solve.

> I usually listen to Taylor Swift because I like her music style. So I guess I can say she's my favorite artist. To add, I also listen to Filipino songs as you can see in the playlists above.

Sometimes, I take a video of myself studying. I'm also intersted in photography especially nature and the things that I see. (Here are some of my videos and pictures):



I also learn to do different things like drawing and cooking during my free time:
